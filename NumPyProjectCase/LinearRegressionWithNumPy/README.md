# What is this project use?
- This project is provides an example implementai of Linear Regression using 
  NumPy a Python library for numerical computations.
- Linear Progression is one of the methods used in Machine Learning to predict the output value based
  on given input values
- Numpy Is Used in this project to perform matrix computations such as multiplication. inverse , and pseudo-inverse 
  required in the normal equation.
- Implementing Linear Regression using NumPy allows us to have a better understanding 
  and control over the algorithm
- This project demonstrates how to add a bias column to the feature matrix to model the bias 
  term in Linear Regression.
